This repository contains CSV tables for slots of 2011 version of Ithkuil language.

Files are UTF-8 encoded with Unix-style (LF) line endings.

If there are two possible slot values for a given set of categories, each value is on its own row.
Some typos/errors in the original tables as published on [www.ithkuil.net](http://www.ithkuil.net) were found and corrected.
Some slots (notably Vc and Vf) are split into separate tables corresponding to different parsing cases.

As of now, not all tables are present.
